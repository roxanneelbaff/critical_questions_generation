2025-03-12 18:44:44 - Validator Agent: llama3.2:latest, Subtask: Specifically assess whether the critical question does not introduce any new concepts or topics, that were not covered in the argument. The introduction of an unmentioned topic or concept would render the question invalid.

Do this in three steps:
1. First, identify the (one or multiple) core topic(s) of the argument.
2. Second, identify the (one or multiple) core topic(s) of the critical question.
3. Finally, assess whether or not there is any significant mismatch between the topics of the argument and those of the question. If there is, assess the significance of the mismatch and give a suggestion on the validity of the question.

Keep your answer concise overall.

2025-03-12 18:44:44 - Validator Agent: llama3.2:latest, Subtask: Specifically assess whether the critical question does not contain any bad reasoning, namely, questions critical positions or claims **that the speaker does not hold**. If the question contains any bad reasoning, it would render the question invalid.

Do this in three steps:
1. First, identify the speakers position on the topic and the claims they make.
2. Second, determine the position and claims that the question suggests the speaker holds."
3. Finally, assess whether there is any mismatch between the speakers actual position and claims and those implied by the question. If there are, assess whether their significance can be neglected or not and give a suggestion on the validity of the question.

Keep your answer concise overall.

2025-03-12 18:44:44 - Validator Agent: llama3.2:latest, Subtask: Specifically assess whether the critical question is focused on the argument. Evaluate whether the question picks up on the core point(s) of the argument and could not be asked on just any argument. If the question is specific to the argument, it can be considered as valid.

Do this in two steps:
1. First, identify the core topic(s) of the argument.
2. Second, assess whether the question adressess the core topic(s) of the argument.
3. Finally, give a suggestion on the validity of the question.

Keep your answer concise overall.
