Airlines themselves already thought up flight status notifications because there was customer demand for them.\nI find it interesting that you claim neither passengers nor profits to be benefiting from the current state of air transit affairs.\nNow, air fare is affordable (prices of air fares have decreased 25% since 1991) and more available to citizens than ever before.\nAirlines like Southwest are benefiting exactly because they are offering low fares, serving their customer needs, which would seem to disprove your statement that both profits and passengers suffer in the status quo.\"",
