2025-03-12 21:07:32 - Validator Agent: llama3.2:latest, Subtask: Specifically assess whether the critical question does not introduce any new concepts or topics, that were not covered in the argument. The introduction of an unmentioned topic or concept would render the question invalid.

Do this in three steps:
1. First, identify the (one or multiple) broad topic(s) of the argument.
2. Second, identify the (one or multiple) core topic(s) of the critical question.
3. Finally, assess whether or not the core topic of the critical question is part of the topics of the argument. If it is, the question can remain valid. If the core topic is different to the topics mentioned and implied in the argument, then the question should be invalid.

Keep your answer concise overall. Don't be too strict in your assessment.

2025-03-12 21:07:32 - Validator Agent: llama3.2:latest, Subtask: Specifically assess whether the critical question does not contain any bad reasoning, namely, questions critical positions or claims **that the speaker does not hold**. If the question contains such bad reasoning, it would render the question invalid.

Do this in three steps:
1. First, identify the speakers overall position on the topic and the claims they make.
2. Second, determine the position and claims that the question suggests the speaker holds.
3. Finally, evaluate whether there is any significant mismatch between the speaker's actual position and claims and those implied by the question. If such a mismatch exists, assess whether its significance remains acceptable, considering that this is a critical question for that argument. If the mismatch is too inacceptable, the question is invalid. If the mismatch is not too impactfull, the question can remain valid. Give a final suggestion on the validity of the question.

Keep your answer concise overall. Don't be too strict in your assessment.

2025-03-12 21:07:32 - Validator Agent: llama3.2:latest, Subtask: Specifically assess whether the critical question adresses the argument. Evaluate whether the question picks up on parts of the argument at all. If the question is specific to the argument, it can be considered as valid.

Do this in two steps:
1. First, identify the core topic(s) of the argument.
2. Second, assess whether the question adressess any of the core topic(s) of the argument.
3. Finally, give a suggestion on the validity of the question. If it adresses any of the arguments core topics, it should be valid. If it adresses none of the core topics, it should be invalid.

Keep your answer concise overall. Don't be too strict in your assessment.
