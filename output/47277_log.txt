2025-03-12 19:26:33 - Validator Agent: llama3.2:latest, Subtask: Specifically assess whether the critical question does not introduce any new concepts or topics, that were not covered in the argument. The introduction of an unmentioned topic or concept would render the question invalid.

Do this in three steps:
1. First, identify the (one or multiple) core topic(s) of the argument.
2. Second, identify the (one or multiple) core topic(s) of the critical question.
3. Finally, assess whether or not there is any significant mismatch between the topics of the argument and those of the question. If there is, assess the significance of the mismatch and give a suggestion on the validity of the question.

Keep your answer concise overall.
