2. Second, identify the (one or multiple) core topic(s) of the critical question.
3. Finally, assess whether or not there is any significant mismatch between the topics of the argument and those of the question. If there is, assess the significance of the mismatch and give a suggestion on the validity of the question.

Keep your answer concise overall.
