2025-03-12 20:19:07 - Validator Agent: llama3.2:latest, Subtask: Specifically assess whether the critical question does not introduce any new concepts or topics, that were not covered in the argument. The introduction of an unmentioned topic or concept would render the question invalid.

Do this in three steps:
1. First, identify the (one or multiple) core topic(s) of the critical question.
2. Second, identify whether the core topic(s) of the question can be found in the argument. Given that this is a critical question to the argument, the core points might not have to be mentioned explicitly.
3. Finally, make a suggestion on the usefulness ofsignificantly different to the topics mentioned and implied in the argument, then the question is not usefull.

Keep your answer concise overall.

2025-03-12 20:19:07 - Validator Agent: llama3.2:latest, Subtask: Specifically assess whether the critical question does not contain any bad reasoning, namely, questions critical positions or claims **that the speaker does not hold**. If the question contains such bad reasoning, it would render the question invalid.

Do this in three steps:
1. First, determine the position and claims that the question suggests the speaker holds.
2. Second, verify if the speaker’s actual position and claims align with those suggested by the question.
3. ally, assess whether the speaker’s actual position and claims align with those suggested by the question. If there is a significant overlap, the question can be considered useful. However, if the mismatch is substantial, the question may be deemed unhelpful. Provide a final recommendation on the usefulness of the question based on this evaluation.

Keep your answer concise overall.

2025-03-12 20:19:07 - Validator Agent: llama3.2:latest, Subtask: Specifically assess whether the critical question adresses the argument. Evaluate whether the question picks up on parts of the argument at all. If the question is specific to the argument, it can be considered as valid.

Do this in two steps:
1. First, identify the core topic(s) of the argument.
2. Second, assess whether the question adressess any of the core topic(s) of the argument.
3. Finally, give a suggestion on the validity of the question. If it adresses any of the arguments core topics, it should be valid. If it adresses none of the core topics, it should be invalid.

Keep your answer concise overall.
