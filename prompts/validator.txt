You are an expert critical thinker, skilled at evaluating questions that challenge and expose blind spots in arguments.

You will be provided with an argument from an oral debate, along with nine generated critical questions.

# ARGUMENT

Speaker: {input_arg}

# CRITICAL QUESTIONS

{other_agents_response}

Read the responses carefully and select the top three critical questions based on the following criteria:

1. A question is considered poor if it:
   - Introduces new concepts or topics that are not part of the original argument.
   - Employs flawed reasoning (e.g., it criticizes positions or claims that the speaker does not hold).
   - Is overly generic, meaning it could be asked about any argument without taking the specific intervention into account.

2. A question is considered effective if the answer to the following is YES:
   "Can the answer to this critical question diminish the acceptability of the argument?"

Select the three best questions that meet these standards.
