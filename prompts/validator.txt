You will be provided with an argument from an oral debate, along with nine generated critical questions.

# ARGUMENT

Speaker: {input_arg}

# CRITICAL QUESTIONS

{other_agents_response}
Read the responses carefully and select the top three critical questions based on the following criteria:

   - A question must not introduce a new concept or topic that are not part of the original argument.
   - A question must not employ flawed reasoning (e.g., it criticizes positions or claims that the speaker does not hold).
   - A question must not be generic, but rather specific to the argument.

Select the three best questions.
