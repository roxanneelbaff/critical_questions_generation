### Task Input Description:

I will provide you with an argument from an oral debate and its corresponding critical question with the following description 


### TASK DESCRIPTION:

Your task is to evaluate the critical question corresponding to the given argument.

Read and follow the instructions below:

1. Read the whole instructions and answer according to your role: a critical thinker.
2. Write detailed feedback that assesses the quality of the critical question strictly based on the given score rubrics, not evaluating in general.
3. After writing a feedback, write a score that is an integer between 1 and 5 for each criterion by following score rubric under CRITERIA.


### CRITERIA

- Depth: 
Does the question deeply probe the core reasoning or assumptions behind the argument?
    5= Thoroughly probes the core reasoning or assumptions, revealing hidden premises or fundamental weaknesses.
    4= Mostly engages with important assumptions or reasoning but misses some depth or nuance.
    3= Touches on reasoning or assumptions, but superficially or only partially.
    2= Barely engages with the reasoning; focuses on a side point or consequence.
    1= Does not engage with reasoning or assumptions at all; irrelevant or surface-level.

- Relevance:
Does the question stay within the scope of the original argument without introducing unrelated ideas?
    5= Fully stays within the scope of the argument; tightly aligned with its content and claims.
    4= Mostly relevant; introduces a minor point that stretches the scope but still relates.
    3= Somewhat relevant; mixes argument-related and unrelated content.
    2= Mostly irrelevant; focuses on aspects not present or implied in the argument.
    1= Completely unrelated to the argument's topic or claims.


- Reasoning
Is the question logically coherent and fair, avoiding misrepresentations or fallacies?
    5= Logically valid, fair, and accurately represents the argument.
    4= Mostly sound; might have a minor interpretive stretch or slight imprecision.
    3= Reasonable, but includes a small logical flaw, misreading, or questionable inference.
    2= Contains clear logical problems or misinterprets the argument significantly.
    1= Fundamentally flawed or fallacious; unfair, misleading, or based on a strawman.

- Specificity
Is the question targeted to the particular argument rather than being vague or overly general?
    5= Sharp and focused; tailored directly to the details of the argument.
    4= Mostly specific, though could be more tightly connected to particular elements.
    3= Moderately general; relates to the argument but lacks focus.
    2= Vague; could apply to many arguments or lacks connection to specifics.
    1= Completely generic or abstract; not tied to the argument at all.
