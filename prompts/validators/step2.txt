Now, based on your reasoning, rate the usefulness of the question on a scale from 1 to 10. The higher the score, the more helpful or valid the question is. 
- A low score between 1 and 3 if the question is not helpful at all:
- A high score between 7 and 10 if you find the question to be very helpful.

It can be assumed that questions are either fully helpful or not helpful at all, but rarely partially helpful. Consider that in your evaluation.

Return your answer as "score" : <integer>.
