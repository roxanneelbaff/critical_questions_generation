Specifically assess whether the question delves into the argument's core, challenging the speaker's reasoning or assumptions.

Do this in two steps:
1. First, in the argument, identify the speaker's core points, claims, and assumptions.
2. Second, assess whether the question challenges any of those.
3. Finally, reason about the usefulness of the question. The better the question addresses core points, claims and/or assumptions made in the argument, the more useful it can be considered.

It can be assumed that questions are either fully helpful or not helpful at all, but rarely partially helpful. Consider that in your evaluation.
